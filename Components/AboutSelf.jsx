          Since beginning my journey as a freelance designer 12 years ago, I&#39;ve done remote work for agencies, consulted for startups, and collaborated with talented people to create digital products for both business and consumer use. I&#39;m quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on improving my chops.
